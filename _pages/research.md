## Works in progress

[**The Effects of Job Loss on Crime: Evidence from Administrative Data**](/files/jobloss_crime_ekr_vf.pdf)  
Submitted
<dl><dd>This paper investigates the effects of job loss on recidivism using a novel merge of employer-employee wage data to administrative records on crime. I first use firm-level employment shocks to study the reduced form impact of job loss on offending. I then use a kink in unemployment insurance benefits to distinguish economic incentives from other factors, such as incapacitation through time spent at work, as a mechanism. I find that property crimes and domestic violence rise sharply after a layoff and remain elevated for up to two years. Economic incentives are an important mechanism, consistent with Becker-Ehrlich models.</dd></dl>

[**Does Banning the Box Help Ex-Offenders Get Jobs? Evaluating the Effects of a Prominent Example**](/files/btb_seattle_0418.pdf)  
Submitted; [*Online appendix*](/files/btb_online_appendix_0418.pdf)
<dl><dd>I evaluate a 2013 “ban the box” (BTB) ordinance passed in Seattle, WA, that bars employers from asking prospective hires about their criminal records until after an initial screening. I first use a statistical discrimination model to show that although BTB must have opposite effects on individuals with and without records, employment effects on demographic groups with high record shares are ambiguous. I then test whether Seattle’s law affected individuals with records using administrative earnings data for 300,000 ex-offenders. I find that BTB had no impact on ex-offenders’ employment or wages, regardless of their race, across multiple difference-in-differences specifications.</dd></dl>


## Published work

[**The Rise and Fall of Female Labor Force Participation During World War II in the United States**](/files/rise_and_fall.pdf)  
*The Journal of Economic History*, Vol. 78, No. 3 (September 2018); [*Online appendix*](/files/rise_and_fall_online_appendix.pdf)
<dl><dd>I use new data on employment and job placements during WWII to characterize the wartime surge in female work and its subsequent impact on female employment in the United States. The geography of female wartime work was primarily driven by industrial mobilization, not drafted men’s withdrawal from local labor markets. After the war, returning veterans and sharp cutbacks in war-related industries displaced many new female entrants, despite interest in continued work. As a result, areas most exposed to wartime work show limited overall effects on female labor force participation in 1950 and only marginal increases in durables manufacturing employment.</dd></dl>
