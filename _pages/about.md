<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="320">I am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are Labor Economics, Public Economics, and Applied Econometrics. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in New York City, where I moved after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I will join the University of Chicago's Economics Department as an Assistant Professor in 2022 after spending the 2020-21 academic year as a Postdoctoral Reseracher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge and 2021-22 as a Saieh Family Research Fellow at the Becker Friedman Institute. 

If you'd like to contact me, you can email ekrose at berkeley.edu. You can find a current version of my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv_12-09-19_jmp_long.pdf). I'm on Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dMs-BJUAAAAJ).
