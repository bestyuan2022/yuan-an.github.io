Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. I work mainly on topics in labor, human capital, discrimination, and crime. 

If you'd like to contact me, you can email ekrose at uchicago.edu. You can find a relatively current version of my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv.pdf). I'm on Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dMs-BJUAAAAJ). I have a largely neglected Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/evankrose).

You can listen to me talk about some of my work on the Microsoft Research podcast [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/podcast/econ1-using-microeconomics-to-solve-mass-incarceration-featuring-hunt-allcott-and-evan-rose/) and on InequaliTalks [here](https://inequalitalks.fireside.fm/21).
