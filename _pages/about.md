I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work mainly on topics in digital economics with a focus on labor and consumer markets, using empirical evidence and economic theory.

My research focuses on studying how labor and consumer markets of new forms and structures driven by technological innovation function, and efficiency and incidence of market institutions designed to adapt to new market features in these markets.
