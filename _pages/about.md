<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.png" width="320">I am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are Labor Economics, Public Economics, and Applied Econometrics. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in New York City, where I moved after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am on the Economics job market this year. I will be available for interviews at the 2020 ASSA Meetings in San Diego. 

If you'd like to contact me, you can email ekrose at berkeley.edu. You can find a current version of my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv_08-23-19_jmp_nc.pdf).
