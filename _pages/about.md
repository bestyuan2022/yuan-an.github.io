<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;" src="/images/profile.png" width="250"> I am an Economics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are Public and Labor Economics. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in New York City, where I moved after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

If you'd like to contact me, you can email ekrose at econ.berkeley.edu. You can find a recent version of my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv_06-06-17.pdf).
