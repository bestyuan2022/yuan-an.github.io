I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work mainly on topics in digital and labor economics, using empirical evidence and economic theory. I study efficiency and incidence of market institutions in labor and consumer markets of new forms and structures driven by technological innovation, and intervention design that adapts to new market features.
