<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="320">I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, MA. I work mainly on topics in labor, human capital, discrimination, and crime. In 2020, I graduated (virtually) from UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in New York City, where I moved after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I will join the University of Chicago's Economics Department as a Neubauer Family Assistant Professor in 2022 after spending the 2021-22 academic year as a Saieh Family Research Fellow at the Becker Friedman Institute. 

If you'd like to contact me, you can email ekrose at gmail.com. You can find a relatively current version of my CV [here](/files/ekr_cv_12-09-19_jmp_long.pdf). I'm on Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dMs-BJUAAAAJ). I have a largely neglected Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/evankrose).

You can listen to me talk about some of my work on the Microsoft Research podcast [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/podcast/econ1-using-microeconomics-to-solve-mass-incarceration-featuring-hunt-allcott-and-evan-rose/).
