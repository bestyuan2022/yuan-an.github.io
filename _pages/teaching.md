I teach a graduate course in labor and public economics at the University of Chicago (ECON 34460). I also teach Honors Econometrics (ECON 21030).  All course materials will be posted on Canvas. 

While at Berkeley I served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) for ECON 202A, a first-year PhD course in macroeconomics focused on growth, since the Fall of 2015. If you're looking for 202A materials, please check the b-courses website.

I also taught mathematics courses regularly at San Quentin State Prison through the [Prison University Project](https://prisonuniversityproject.org/).
