I have served as a graduate student instructor (GSI) for ECON 202A, a first-year PhD course in macroeconomics focused on growth, 
since the Fall of 2015. If you're looking for 202A materials, please check the b-courses website.

I also teach mathematics courses regularly at San Quentin State Prison through the [Prison University Project](https://prisonuniversityproject.org/). 

[Here](/files/teaching_evaluations_EKR.pdf) is a summary of my evaluations across all my teaching experience.
